# 🌦️ Weather Dashboard in Power BI (Live API Integration)

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a **real-time dynamic weather dashboard** in Power BI for five major Indian cities using **live API integration**, enabling visualization of key weather metrics and trends in an intuitive, interactive interface.

---

## 🏙️ Cities Covered

- Ahmedabad  
- New Delhi  
- Kolkata  
- Bengaluru  
- Bhopal  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Power BI**
- **Weather API (REST-based)**
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**
- **Power Query**
- **Custom visuals and KPI cards**

---

## 🔄 Project Flow

### 1. 🔗 API Integration
- Fetched real-time weather data via a public weather API for each target city.

### 2. 🔧 Data Transformation
- Cleaned and transformed the raw JSON response using **Power Query Editor**.
- Converted formats: temperature (to °C), pressure (to hPa), and timestamps (to IST).

### 3. 📊 Data Modeling
- Designed a clean, scalable data model with proper relationships.
- Added calculated columns/measures for metrics like:
  - **Air Quality Index (AQI)**
  - **UV Index**
  - **Sunrise/Sunset in local time**

### 4. 🎨 Visual Design
Created a **dark-themed, interactive dashboard** showing:
- Current weather conditions with city selection
- Forecast temperature trends (line chart)
- AQI and pollutant levels (O₃, SO₂, CO, PM 2.5, PM 10)
- UV Index, humidity, wind speed
- Sunrise & sunset times
- Daily chance of rain (bar chart)
- Custom icons, tooltips, and dynamic cards

### 5. 🧩 Interactivity
- City selection via dropdown  
- Hover tooltips for deeper insights  
- Dynamic visuals and metrics update in real-time

## 📈 Key Metrics Visualized

- 🌡️ **Temperature (°C)** with forecast trends  
- 🌬️ **Air Quality Index (AQI)** with pollutant breakdown  
- 💧 **Humidity, Wind Speed, Pressure**  
- 🌅 **Sunrise & Sunset times**  
- 🌧️ **Chance of Rain** (bar chart)  
- 🌞 **UV Index, Visibility, Precipitation**

---

## ✅ Outcome

- Developed a real-time, visually compelling dashboard integrating live weather data.
- Showcased advanced skills in **data extraction**, **cleaning**, **modeling**, and **storytelling** with Power BI.
- Highly useful for **logistics**, **outdoor planning**, or any **weather-sensitive operations**.
